## History

### Year 460 - The beginning 

__Commit:__ 9f4c31e71e676816c967baf61a5cd10ea3cad874

A few brave dwarves decide to form a new civilization called "The Plank of Bells". They set off into the wilderness,
eventually settling on a fantastic area that contains the key ingrediants of sand, magma, and water. They call the
area Roughbasis.

The embark location is a peaceful biome with fruit trees, fishing at a local stream, etc. The dwarves dig basic
living quarters, assemble a few workshops, a trade depot, and start planting a farm. Most importantly of all they
begin digging a tunnel towards the nearby volcano to transport magma to the fortress for future magma forge operation.

### Year 461 - Economy ramping up

The dwarves has finished their magma tunnel and have built magma forges. Unfortunately the tunnel is quite long
and the magma has taken nearly half a year to slowly make its way towards the fortress so the magma forges are
not opeartional yet.

The dwarves have begun to work on defense, by bricking up their original entrance and instead making a new
entrance behind the trade depot. Since trade caravans are usually accompanied by a few soldiers, and attackers usually
invade while a trade caravan is visiting this provides a bit more defense for the civilization as it currently has
no soldiers of its own.

### Year 462 - Glass economy thriving, defenses improved

The magma forges are now fully operational and being used to mass produce glass spikes. The glass spikes are being
used to build menacing spike traps in a narrow hallway which will function as the new front door to the fortress.
Since the civilization is still nowhere near ready to train soldiers it will need to have a great trap based
defense system, but at least it won't be fully dependent on caravan soldiers anymore.

In addition to defense, a couple dwarves have been designated as full time engravers and are busy honing their craft
on a large area underneath the fort. Over the next four to five years they will become legendary engravers, which
will allow for some great engraving work on future projects.

### Year 463 - Attacks (and a megaproject) begin.

The dwarf civilization has finally had its first contact with the local goblin civilization "The Spider of Spurts".
The Spider of Spirts has a long and glorious 400 year history of slaughtering giant dingos, tiger men, and isolated
dwarves that wandered into the wrong neighborhood. None of that prepared them for their attack on The Plank of Bells.
The entire goblin squad was skewered to death by those menacing glass spike traps prepared last year.

Casually ignoring the foolish invaders the dwarves have continued work on the next phase: a mega project. The goal is
to create a cast obsidian tower (by combining magma and water) and then carve rooms into it so that it is their new
home. So far an underground foundation for the tower has been hollowed out and two vast reservoirs (one for magma, and one for
water) have been dug under the site of the future tower.
